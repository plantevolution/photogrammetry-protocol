# Materials

## Lighting

It is important to have good lighting conditions to take the
photographs. To optimize the lighting conditions, we use a [Neewer
portable lighting box](https://neewer.com/collections/shooting-tent) to
recreate lighting studio conditions and reduce shading on the object to
a maximum. This lightbox needs to be powered from an outlet or from an
external battery. The color of the background used should contrast with
the color of the flowers to be photographed.

## Turn table

We use an automated turntable and shutter release device ([Syrp Genie
mini II and
turntable](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1486043-REG/syrp_sykit_0043_genie_mini_ii_turntable.html/quick-compare))
to rotate each flower on itself (360) and trigger a predetermined number
of pictures from the camera to get pictures from all around the flower.
The genie mini II has several hours of autonomy according to its use,
but it can be plugged in a source of energy during the process (external
battery, plug, or usb). This device is easily controlled and set
remotely via its application \"Syrp\" (Figure
[1](#fig:syrp_app){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:syrp_app"}) on
any kind of smartphone by Bluetooth
([Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/syrp/id1387335063) or
[Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.syrp.genie2&hl=fr_CA&gl=US))
after the device has been paired with your phone and after any updates
suggested by the device has been done.

We also use a 1cm scale placed adjacently to the flower, and include a
label describing the species name, collection number, date of
collection, location, and coordinates.

## Camera

It is important to have very sharp pictures for optimal model
construction. However, a professional camera is not necessary. We
obtained good results with a Canon T2i/550D camera that shoots 18.0 MP
RAW photos (5184 x 3456 pixels). We recommend a fixed macro lens (we use
a 60mm fixed Canon lens). Avoid using a lens that isn't fixed : zooming
in and out can create artifacts during the model reconstruction. Ideally
the flower should take a large portion of the photographs for best
results. We also use a flexible short tripod to support the camera and
easily modify the angle at which we take each series of photos.

## Color chart

To calibrate the photos for color, we use a [Xrite ColorChecker Passport
Photo
2](https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colorchecker-classic-family/colorchecker-passport-photo-2).
The main target that we use is the classic target with a 24-patch color
reference target to create Digital Negative (DNG) (@Adobe2012DNG) camera
profiles from a raw photo (called DNG conversion), and the 75% neutral
gray patch to calibrate for light exposure.

![Xrite color chart details for standard Red Green and Blue (sRGB)
values. The 75% neutral gray has values of 0.33 (85/255) for Red Green
Blue channels in the LightRoom
software.](Figures/Color_chart_sRGB_values.pdf){#fig:xrite_description
width="7cm"}


## Software

To convert RAW photos (CR2 for Canon Raw Version 2 image files) to DNG
files, we either use directly [Adobe Lightroom
Classic](https://www.adobe.com/ca_fr/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html)
to export in DNG format the CR2 photos or [Adobe DNG
converter](https://helpx.adobe.com/camera-raw/using/adobe-dng-converter.html).
To calibrate the photos according to the color chart, we use the [Xrite
Color
Checker](https://xritephoto.com/ph_product_overview.aspx?ID=938&Action=Support&SoftwareID=2030)
software to create DCP camera profiles from DNG files, and Adobe
Lightroom to use these profiles and apply them on an entire set of
photos that need the same calibration. To reconstruct the 3D models from
photos, we use [Agisoft
Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/).

## Flowers

Collect fresh flowers from the plant, label them and store them in a
cool place or with the tip of the peduncle in some water to prevent
accelerated wilting. Different flowers will wilt at different paces.
Flowers are pinned through the floral receptacle or peduncle using
entomological pins in dense foam at the center of the turntable.
Alternatively, flowers can be secured in a truncated pipette tip, itself
fixed on the turntable, or with alligator clips to rapidly fix the
flowers.

::: tcolorbox
Store flowers in 50mL Eppendorf tubes or in foam box no more than an
hour before taking photos of them.\
\
In some cases, it is necessary to remove sepals from the flower before
building the model to accurately study the corolla shape. To do this,
use a razor blade and mark the sepal intersections with a waterproof
pen. The marks will help for the model construction and more importantly
landmarks positioning.
