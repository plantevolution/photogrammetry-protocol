# Image capture step-by-step

## Take a picture of the color chart

1.  Set the camera settings to F/16, ISO 100, 1/20s, and RAW format.

2.  Verify that you have enough space on your SD card for RAW photos (a
    minimum of 163 photos, accounting for photos of labels and chart).

3.  Verify that the placement of your turntable inside the lightbox will
    allow to capture correctly the flower you are about to photograph
    (distance from opening of the lightbox) and that the 1/20s shutter
    speed captures enough light from your flower by taking an initial
    photo of your flower.

4.  If satisfactory go to next step. The goal here is to have a definite
    set of settings that will match both your flower photos and a color
    chart to subsequently calibrate all your photos that have the same
    light conditions and camera settings.

5.  Place the color chart where the flower will be placed, without
    shadows, and exposed under the same light as the flower will be
    (angled towards the LED source light in the lightbox). The camera
    settings and lighting cannot be changed after this. If the lighting
    or the camera settings are modified, the color chart needs to be
    taken again to correct the corresponding photos.

6.  Place the camera so that the entire chart is visible.

7.  Take a picture of the color chart (RAW). Make sure to Incorporate
    each color squares, and the corners of the chart as follows (Figure
    \@ref(fig:chart)).

```{r chart, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Colour chart photo taken at the beginning of the process to calibrate the photos in post process.", out.width = '33%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/chart_example.png")
```


## Flower placement & Image capture

To reconstruct an accurate 3D model, it is very important to have
pictures of all the parts and details of the flowers and from several
angles. Also, the photographs need to overlap with each other for proper
alignment in the first steps of the reconstruction. For this reason,
several pictures will be taken of each flower: from different
orientation and all around the flower. We suggest that flowers should be
photographed from at least two positions (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:flower-two-positions)). For more complex flowers, three positions may be required: horizontal, vertical, and upside down (Figure
\@ref(fig:flower-three-positions)). Note that it is better to take
more photos than less because if we can drop some pictures during the
model reconstruction, it is impossible to come back and take more
pictures if we realize that we should have taken more.

```{r flower-two-positions, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Two flower positions that are normally suficient for Gesneriaceae flowers.", out.width = '33%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/position_2.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/position_5.jpg")
```

```{r flower-three-positions, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="More complex flowers can require the pictures to be taken from three flower positions.", out.width = '33%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/flowerplacement_1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/flowerplacement_2.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/flowerplacement_3.jpg")
```

>For Gesneriaceae, we first suggest a standard orientation and an
upside-down position (Figure \@ref(fig:flower-two-positions)) of the flower as this generally gives satisfactory results . For more complex flowers, three positions may be required: horizontal, vertical, and upside down (Figure
\@ref(fig:flower-three-positions)).


1.  Clip the camera on the flexible tripod (gorillapod) and place the
    camera at one of the three position required per flower position :
    high mid, and low position (see Figure \@ref(fig:camera-positions).
    Make sure to not use different
    camera orientations (landscape vs. portrait).

2.  If sepals need to be removed, use a razor blade to cut them at the
    base and mark the sepal intersections with a waterproof pen to keep
    track of the morphological structures.

3.  Pin the flower through the peduncle or the floral receptacle and
    through a block of dense foam or malleable gum. You can use several
    pins to avoid any sliding of the flower during the image capture
    process.

4.  Make sure to place the flower so that the whole flower will be
    encompassed in the camera frame as much as possible. It is best to
    have the subject to take the most place as possible in the camera
    frame to capture every details overall than having it entirely in
    the camera frame but with poor detail quality. What counts the most
    is to get several overlapping photos for each features. Make sure
    that the flower is not in contact with anything as this would deform
    the flower and create problems during the model reconstruction.

5.  For flowers with very uniform color or with radial symmetry, it may
    be important to place dots with a waterproof pen on the corolla to
    facilitate manual marker positioning and/or automated pixel position
    detection in the reconstruction step.

6.  Place a scale (e.g., 1 cm) directly below the flower.

7.  Take a picture of the flower with the label for each new positioning
    of the flower. This will help to identify each group of images in
    the following model construction.

8.  Press the *rec* button on your smartphone using the turntable
    interface to start the spin of the turntable and automated image
    capture.

9.  Verify occasionally the focus on the flower while the flower rotates
    by pressing the square button (stop) and manually adjust the focus
    if needed, then press rec to resume your spin.

```{r camera-positions, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="The three camera positions from which pictures should be taken for each flower position.", out.width = '33%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/camera_position_1.JPG")
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/camera_position_2.JPG")
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/camera_position_3.JPG")
```


>Adjust the number of flower positions and number of photos according to each flower. For intricate flowers, or flowers that can't be captured entirely with only two positions (ventral and dorsal), you can place the flower on an another position (Figure \@ref(fig:flower-three-positions)). On the contrary, if the flower can't be placed on several positions, you may need to increase the number of photos per camera height in order to have sufficient information for the software to reconstruct accurate 3D models.
