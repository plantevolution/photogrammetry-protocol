# Flower photogrammetry and 3D modeling protocol

The protocol can be read online here: http://www.plantevolution.org/photogrammetry-protocol/

This protocol is an evolving protocol used in the Joly lab at the Université de Montréal (Canada)

This protocol describes how to obtain three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of flowers using photogrammetry. It describes in details the set-up, settings and steps that has worked for us for building accurate flower models, but other approaches are certainly possible. Hence, we hope this protocol serves as a starting point rather than a final protocol. We welcome any comments.
