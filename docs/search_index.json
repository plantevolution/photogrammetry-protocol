It describes in details the set-up, settings and steps that has worked for us for building accurate flower models, but other approaches are certainly possible. Hence, we hope this protocol serves as a starting point rather than a final protocol. We welcome any comments. 1.1 Citation Leménager, M., J. Burkiewicz, D. J. Schoen, S. Joly.

Please do not hesitate to fork the protocol, modify it and make pull requests to improve it! 1.3 Disclaimer We provide this protocol as guidelines, without any guaranty. It has worked well for us for many types of flowers, but there is no guaranty that it will work on all flowers. "]]
